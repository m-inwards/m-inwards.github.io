      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="custom-underline"></div>
      <p>Im Matt and I tend to specialize in Python and MySQL, with plenty of dabbling into other areas such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
      <p>My education was initially a broad overview across all areas of ICT while I was getting my Level 3 Extended Diploma in ICT. This has since been specialised by my degree into computer science and a much stronger programming background.</p>
      <p>For my professional experience I have spent all my time in the educational sector developing apps/databases for internal usage while providing IT support and also applications for usage in an education environment by teachers and office staff.</p>
